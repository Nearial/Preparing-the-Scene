# Preparing-the-Scene + The Elm Frontend

* The project is spilt up into 6 Elm modules and a Java application Backend.

* The backend is to be run locally.

* The first module is the Types module, which contains different types of objects and models we're working with in the project.

* The second module is the Decoder which handles the JSON objects and decodes them into usable data for elm.

* The third module is APIFacade which handles the get requests from our API.

* The fourth and fifth modules are both used for displaying the tables containing the data we collect in the APIFacade.

* The Main module strings this all together.
